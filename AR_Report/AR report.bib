	abstract = {This study aims to analyze the influence of multi-sensory feedback on the immersive virtual reality experience. The research background is the increasing popularity and application of virtual reality technology in various fields. The research purposes are to investigate the impact of multi-sensory feedback on the sense of presence and realism in virtual environments. The research method involves conducting an experiment with participants immersed in a virtual reality experience and comparing the effects of different levels of sensory feedback. The research results indicate that the provision of multi-sensory feedback significantly enhances the sense of presence and realism, as well as the overall immersive experience. Participants reported higher levels of engagement and enjoyment when multiple senses were engaged. The research concludes that the incorporation of multi-sensory feedback can improve the quality of immersive virtual reality experiences and enhance user satisfaction.},

	abstract = {Gesture-based interaction constitutes the prominent interaction modality for Augmented Reality (AR) systems. In this state-of-the-art review, we classify the recent literature on hand gesture-based AR interaction techniques, concerning the various domains where AR is gaining a foothold. Based on the conducted analysis, a taxonomy is introduced for the classification of the various reported techniques on the grounds of their application domain, the context of use, gestures recognition method, and types of gestures used. Furthermore, the discussed analysis reveals that context of use is a factor to take into account when determining the gestures that should be employed when developing an AR application. At the same time, there is a trade-off between touch-based and mid-air gestures, regarding their simplicity and user engagement entailed, which needs to be carefully considered. In all cases, it is of utmost importance that AR gesture-based systems are designed following a human-centered approach. The analysis conducted and reported in this paper aims to motivate the informed development and integration of hand gesture interaction of AR applications in various contexts and provide information on the different approaches that can be employed.},

	abstract = {The majority of digital games available today offer a variety of multi-player settings including co-located and mediated play between opponents. Immersion, the sense of being “in the game,” is one of the key components of the gaming experience but existing literature suggests that social play provides more fun but less immersion. There is however little empirical support for this. This paper therefore addresses the question: how does playing digital games in a social situation alter the sense of immersion felt by the individuals playing? This paper presents three experiments that test the relationship between social setting and immersion. The three experiments aim to manipulate the social setting in which players play, be it against a computer, against a person online or against a co-located person. Overall the three experiments show that players are more immersed when playing against another person rather than playing against a computer but there is no significant difference in immersion whether the other person is online or in the same room. This refutes previous claims about social play reducing immersion and indeed that social play enhances the sense of being in the game where interaction is through the game.},
